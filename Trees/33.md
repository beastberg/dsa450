### Kth ancestor in a tree
```cpp
```

# K-th Ancestor Algorithm in Binary Tree

## ✅ **What this code does**
It finds the **k-th ancestor** of a given `node` in a binary tree.

## 🧠 **How it works**
1. **`helper()` function**
   * Performs DFS traversal.
   * Tries to find the path from root to the given node.
   * If the node is found, the path is stored in the `path` vector.

2. **`kthAncestor()` function**
   * Calls `helper()` to populate the path.
   * Reverses the path (so that the node is at index 0).
   * Returns the `k`-th ancestor if it exists; otherwise, returns -1.

## 🌳 **Example Tree**

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \
    4   5
       /
      6
```

Let's say: 🔍 Find `2nd` ancestor of `node = 6`.

## 🔄 Step-by-Step Dry Run

1. **`helper(root=1, k=6, path=[])`**
   * 1 is added → `path = [1]`
   * Recurse to left child

2. **`helper(root=2, k=6, path=[1])`**
   * 2 is added → `path = [1, 2]`
   * Recurse to left child (4) → not found
   * Recurse to right child

3. **`helper(root=5, k=6, path=[1, 2])`**
   * 5 is added → `path = [1, 2, 5]`
   * Recurse to left child

4. **`helper(root=6, k=6, path=[1, 2, 5])`**
   * 6 is added → `path = [1, 2, 5, 6]`
   * Node found ✅ → return true

Backtrack through recursion, confirming the node was found.

**Final `path = [1, 2, 5, 6]`**

**Reversed → `[6, 5, 2, 1]`**

`k = 2`, so return `path[2] = 2`

## ✅ **Answer: 2nd ancestor of 6 is 2**

## 🔁 Edge Case
If `k >= path.size()` (e.g., `k = 10`), return `-1` because there aren't enough ancestors.

# Short-Circuit Evaluation in Binary Tree Path Finding

Great question! The short answer is:

**❌ No,** if `getPath(root->left, target, path)` returns `true`, then `getPath(root->right, ...)` is never executed.

## 📘 Let's break it down:

```cpp
if (getPath(root->left, target, path) || getPath(root->right, target, path))
```

* This uses the **logical OR** (`||`) operator.
* In **C++ (and most programming languages)**, `||` uses **short-circuit evaluation**.

## 🔄 Short-circuit evaluation:

| Condition | What Happens |
|-----------|--------------|
| If **left side is** `true` | **Right side is skipped** |
| If **left side is** `false` | Right side is **evaluated** |

## 🧪 Example:

Let's say your tree looks like:

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
```

You are searching for node `2`.

* `getPath(root->left, 2, path)` → returns `true`
* Since `true || ...` is already true, it **skips** evaluating `getPath(root->right, ...)`

## ✅ Why this is good:
* Saves computation.
* As soon as one path is found, no need to check the other.

## 🧠 Summary:

```cpp
if (A || B)
```

* If `A` is `true`, `B` is never evaluated.
* This is called **short-circuiting**, and it helps optimize recursive tree traversals.
